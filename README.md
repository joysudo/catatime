# Catatime

> Get instant gratification while you code… even when you’re ready to dent a laptop.

Catatime is built around the idea of filling your (coding) cup. When Hackatime/fulfillment is slow, Catatime can at least give you a little bit of instant gratification. 🐈

Each time you reach a goal and successfully fill your cup, your cat friend will bring back some coins to spend on trinkets and accessories.

- Set a goal for daily Hackatime hours
- Spend the coins you earn
- Accessorize your cat the way that you want to

## Behind the Scenes
Catatime is built with a pretty lightweight stack.

| Category | Tool |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Desktop framework | Electron |
| Frontend | React |
| Core logic | Javascript |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS |
| Backend | Express |

Our backend was built by **Kat Wang**, frontend by **Joy Su**, and design/assets by **Kaylee Dinh**. 
The entire project was conceptualized, built, and shipped during Hack Club’s **Parthenon** hackathon. Lots of love to the staff and friends who morally and technically supported us during this challenge. 🩷
